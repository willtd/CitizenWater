1. *Increasing size of /dev/root      // This step works for Windows

*THIS MAY DELETE EVERYTHING CURRENTLY ON THE EDISON!

Connect Edison to your computer using both usb wires

Download: 'Yocto complete image' and 'dfu-util':
  - Download "http://downloadmirror.intel.com/25028/eng/edison-image-ww25.5-15.zip"
    - All instructions here are tested with the image contained in the above link. You may encounter some difficulties if you do not use this image.
    - If this link is not available, you may have to download 'Yocto complete image' from "https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/downloads". This may provide you with a different Edison image than the one these instructions were written for.
  - Download 'dfu-util' from https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54378433/dfu-util/dfu-util.exe
  - Extract the contents into a folder.
  - Copy the dfu-util.exe into the same folder you extracted the Yocto image.
  - Open command prompt and go to the directory of the Yocto image and type flashall.bat
 
The message should be "Please plug and reboot the board". Reboot the board and it should start flashing.

=== For the following steps, login to the Edison as 'root' over SSH (root has no password by default) ===

2. Setup wifi   // Internet access required so we can update system programs and pull from repository 

configure_edison --wifi

3. Choose a name // Name will be used to identify your device

configure_edison --name

4. Configuring repository:

source: http://alextgalileo.altervista.org/edison-package-repo-configuration-instructions.html

To configure your Edison to fetch packages from your repo, replace anything you have in /etc/opkg/base-feeds.conf with the following (other opkg config files don't need any changes):
 	===/etc/opkg/base-feeds.conf contents below===
	src/gz all http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/all
	src/gz edison http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/edison
	src/gz core2-32 http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/core2-32
	===end of /etc/opkg/base-feeds.conf contents===

5. Run the command 'opkg update'

6. Run 'opkg install git'

7. Run 'opkg install sudo'

8. Run 'adduser citizenwater'

8b. Run 'passwd citizenwater' (if not previously prompted to give a password)

9. Run 'visudo -f /etc/sudoers' and modify it to give 'citizenwater' root privileges
	- Find the part of the file that is labeled "User priviledge specification". 
	- In a blank line below root, add the new user's name and copy the same privileges that root has. See example below:
	
		# User privilege specification
		root        ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
		citizenwater    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

10. Run 'exit' and then login as citizenwater

=== For the following steps, you should be logged in as 'citizenwater' over SSH ===

11. Run 'git init'

12. Run 'git clone http://github.com/willtd/asu_capstone.git'

13. Run 'cd asu_capstone' and './install.sh'
    // Give relevant passwords when prompted    

14. Reboot the Edison. You can use the command "sudo /sbin/shutdown -r now" to do so.
    (To gracefully shutdown the Edison w/o restarting, use the command sudo /sbin/shutdown now")
